## 🔍 NOTES FOR COPY UPDATE

**Potential Issues Identified:**

1. **Duplicate Names**: "Michael Chen" appears in both flow.html (Managing Partner, Chen & Associates) and index.html (CTO, TechFlow) - **Verify if same person or should be updated**

2. **Image Asset Reuse**: Some testimonial photos are repeated (client-nate.jpg used twice, exo-feedback-13.jpeg used twice, jenn-testimonial.jpeg used twice) - Consider if these should be unique

3. **Company Confirmation Needed**: Several testimonials lack specific company details or verification:
   - Leonardo Marino (Managing Partner - no company name shown)
   - Marcus Rivera (Director of Operations - company mentioned in badge but not in quote)

4. **Client Logo Verification**: 9 client logos/names displayed - recommend verifying these are actual clients or clearly marked as examples

5. **Carousel Animation**: The testimonials rotate with a 18-second fade animation - ensure copy updates maintain similar length for proper display
