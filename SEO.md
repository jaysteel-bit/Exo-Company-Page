Quick Notes:

- Links should be relative to the current page
---

You should treat **Exo Enterprise as the master brand on exoent.co, and Flow OS as the flagship product living as a subdirectory on that same domain, while parking exoflowos.com for later use.** Steel should be treated as a future, separate-but-related brand once it is closer to launch.

## Domain & architecture strategy

- Make **exoent.co** your primary domain and brand home: it matches the “holding company + AI department-in-a-box” thesis and can eventually house Flow OS, Deal OS, Academy, Launch, and Steel in one ecosystem.
- Put **Flow OS** at exoent.co/flow-os (and related pages like /flow-os/bom-t, /flow-os/academy, etc.) instead of a subdomain or standalone site for now, so all authority, backlinks, and content build the same root domain.
- Keep **exoflowos.com** registered but redirect it (301) to exoent.co/flow-os once the page is live; later, if Flow OS becomes large enough to justify its own marketing site, you can reverse this and make exoflowos.com the primary, with exoent.co linking as the parent company.

## Why not subdomain or separate Flow OS site yet

- Flow OS is still in **very early stage** with unproven ICP and no fully built product, so splitting domains now would slow down SEO and brand clarity without giving you a real benefit.
- Subdomains behave like separate sites from an SEO standpoint (separate crawling, separate authority), which means you would be diluting the compounding effect of case studies, content, and backlinks while you are still fighting for first proof points.

### Subdirectory vs subdomain vs own site

| Option | What it looks like | Pros | Cons | Best fit now? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subdirectory | exoent.co/flow-os | Shares authority with main site; simplest storytelling of “Exo → Flow OS → namespaces” | Less “standalone product” feel early on | **Yes** |
| Subdomain | flowos.exoent.co | Slight separation, can theme differently | Separate SEO property, more overhead while pre-PMF | No |
| Separate | exoflowos.com | Strong product identity, easy later if Flow OS is huge | Splits all early energy, content, and links across domains | Later, post-PMF |

## How to structure the exoent.co site

For the current **exoent.co home page** (the tab you are editing), assume this as the core narrative:

- **Home / Overview** (exoent.co): Exo Enterprise as “AI-native firm that builds and runs autonomous departments via Flow OS (department-in-a-box).”
- **Solutions / Flow OS** (exoent.co/flow-os): Deep dive on Flow OS concept: diffs, reflex agents, regret graph, BOM/T delivery, and the “AI department store” framing.
- **Namespaces / Departments** (exoent.co/departments): Lightweight subpages for Deal OS, Exo Launch, Exo Academy, HR/AURA, etc., even if some are “coming soon,” so you can show the modular ecosystem.
- **Services / BOM-T** (exoent.co/services or /bom-t): Explain Build → Operate → Manage/Transfer with timelines, guarantees, and example workflows.
- **Steel (future)** (exoent.co/steel): Simple “under development” landing that anchors Steel as a B2C subsidiary that will later expand into its own brand/domains.

Keep the **visual look** coherent between home and Flow OS (same design system, same brand language) so it feels like one organism, not separate companies.

## Handling Steel (steelglobal.us / steelbyexo.com)

- In your thesis, **Steel by Exo** is explicitly framed as a membership / B2C ecosystem and “separate company feel,” but still powered by Flow OS under the hood. 
- Until you are closer to a Steel MVP, keep Steel as a **section under Exo** (exoent.co/steel or a short “coming soon” page) and **do not** spend energy building full separate sites on steelglobal.us or steelbyexo.com yet. 
- When Steel is ready to stand alone (community, app, physical cards), then:  
  - Make **steelbyexo.com** the hero consumer-facing brand.  
  - Keep a tight “Powered by Exo / Flow OS” line and cross-link between exoent.co and Steel so you benefit from shared authority and story. 

## Navigation & branding choices

- In the **exoent.co nav**, treat Flow OS as the central product: e.g., “Flow OS,” “Departments,” “Services,” “Resources,” “About.” 
- Use the **Flow OS page** as the “hero sales page” that the nav button points to; exoflowos.com simply routes there in the background while you’re early. 
- Make sure the narrative hierarchy is clear across pages:  
  - Exo Enterprise = company / partner  
  - Flow OS = operating system / platform  
  - Namespaces (Deal OS, Launch, Academy) = departments inside the OS  
  - Steel = consumer spin-out built on the same primitives

If you want, next step can be a very concrete sitemap plus example hero copy blocks tailored to the exoent.co home and /flow-os page so you can align the design you are editing to this structure.
