Mozi Minute: Pre-suasion Checkbox Hack

Most opt-in pages try to sell people on signing up. Wrong approach.

You should sell them on what comes after signing up.

We just tested this with a simple checkbox addition and got a 16% revenue per visitor boost during our launch.

Here's what we did:

Added a checkbox above the opt-in that said "I want a VIP ticket."

That’s it.

80% of people checked the box. And here’s the best part - the checkbox did absolutely nothing functional - it was pure psychology.

But it worked.

Why this crushed the control:

People who checked the box had already mentally committed to wanting the upsell before they even became leads.

When they saw the actual upsell (upgrading their order to VIP), they were more likely to take it.

The psychology:

Robert Cialdini calls this "pre-suasion" - the moment before persuasion when you prime someone's mental state.

We weren't asking them to buy.

We were asking them to admit they wanted to see what we'd show them.

Implementation is dead simple:

Add a checkbox above your opt-in form

Make it about wanting to see the upsell on the next page (whatever that next step is)

Don't gate anything behind it

Track the difference in conversion rates

Pure words. Zero tech changes. 16% more revenue from the same traffic.

Considering we did $7M in presales…that’s roughly ~$1M in extra earnings from this one test.

As promised, value in under a minute.
