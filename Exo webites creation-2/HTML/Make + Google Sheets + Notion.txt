Of course! This is a very common situation. You're right to want to ship quickly without rebuilding.

The short answer: You do not need to replace your existing form with Tally. You can keep your beautifully designed form on your website and use a simple automation tool to send the data directly to Google Sheets.

The easiest and fastest way to do this is to use Make.com (formerly Integromat) or Zapier. They act as the "middleman" that catches your form data and puts it in your sheet.

Here is the simplest, fastest path to get your existing form data into Google Sheets:

The "Quick Ship" Method: Using Make.com
This method requires a small, one-time change to your form but then works automatically forever.

What You'll Need:
Your existing website form.

A Make.com account (their free plan is very generous for starting).

A Google Sheet.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Change Your Form's "Action" URL

Right now, your HTML form probably has a line like this:
<form action="/submit-page.php" method="POST">

You need to change this action to a special Webhook URL provided by Make.com.

Go to Make.com and create a new Scenario.

Click the first module and search for "Webhook". Choose "Custom Webhook".

Click "Add" to create a new webhook. Give it a name like "My Website Form".

Make sure the "Payload URL Needs Parsing" option is disabled.

Copy the unique Webhook URL that Make.com generates for you. It will look like https://hook.make.com/....

Go to your website's form code and change the action attribute to this new Webhook URL. Also, change the method to POST if it isn't already.

Your form code should now look something like this:

<form action="https://hook.make.com/your-unique-webhook-url" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Crucially, ensure every form field (input, select, textarea) has a name attribute (e.g., name="email"). This is how Make.com will identify the data.

Step 2: Test the Webhook

Go back to Make.com and click "OK" on the Webhook settings.

Now, go to your live website and submit a test entry in your form.

You should see Make.com instantly detect a new data packet. It will show you the exact structure of the data your form is sending.

Step 3: Add Google Sheets to Make.com

In your Make.com scenario, click the plus sign (+) to add a second module.

Search for and select "Google Sheets".

Choose the action "Add a Row".

Connect your Google account and select the specific Sheet and Tab (worksheet) where you want the data to go.

Now, map the data from your form to the columns in your sheet.

Click in the "Name" column field, and a panel will appear. Select the data from your webhook, e.g., name.

Click in the "Email" column field, and select email from the webhook data.

Repeat for every field in your form.

Step 4: Run It!

Save your scenario and turn it ON.

Go to your website and submit another real form entry.

Watch the magic happen. Within seconds, the entry will appear in your Google Sheet.

Why This is the Best Approach for You Right Now:
Speed: You can set this up in under 15 minutes.

No Rebuilding: Your form's design and user experience remain perfectly intact.

Flexibility: Later, you can easily add more steps to this same Make.com automation. For example, after "Add a Row to Google Sheets," you can add another step to "Create a Database Item in Notion" using the same form data.

Cost: The free plan of Make.com is more than enough to handle this for a new project.

Important Note for Your Future Plan
You mentioned using Tally as a backend. This method bypasses Tally completely. Your data flow is:
Your Website Form -> Make.com -> Google Sheets

Later you can add notion. 

This is actually simpler and more direct for your immediate goal. You can always integrate Tally later if you find you need its specific form-building and management features, but for now, this gets you to a live state with a working data collection system immediately.

Go for it! This is the standard, professional way to connect a custom form to a spreadsheet without any complex coding. Ship it!
