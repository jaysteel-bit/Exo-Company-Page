## YOUTUBE VIDEO ON TRANSCRIPT GUIDENCE
"you're going to go the five Ps, which is proof, promise, pain, plan, picture. Okay. So, what does this mean? It means that I need to make some promise that they're going to get from this video. I need to talk about the pain to demonstrate that I know where they're at right now. I need to give them proof that they that they why they should believe me. And then I'm going to lay out the plan of how I'm going to help them solve it. And then, usually I want that to be a visual so they can understand. Hence the visual, right? And then after I've done all of these things and I go through my plan, right? Duh. Here's my plan. Okay. After I have this kind of meaty part, then I'm going to have what I consider the FAQ section, which is what do people say when they get on the phone that they have questions about. I want to put all of the FAQs, every single one of them, into this video. I want to h I want to pre-handle the objections. And a lot of them are really sensical concerns. How long you've been doing this? How do I know this is legit? Answer all of their concerns in the video. And then finally, I just call it little proof proof stack at the end, which usually just puts stories of successful customers, right? And you can put your CTA here. And then you put another CTA here saying, "By the way, uh, this concludes the video. At the end of this, it's just going to be a testimonial. You can watch this if you want." Now, when you say that, I'll just tell you this right now. You think that people won't watch them, people watch all of them. I'm just letting you know. All right... this works great."

"I'll still have my FAQs still have my proof stack and still have my CTAs this is basically two different versions of the meat and guess what both have worked. But I thought there's this big box box of magic. All we're doing is answering all the questions that someone might reasonably have before making a purchasing decision so that when we get on the phone with them, we can just help them make a purchasing decision rather than having two calls where we're giving them information before they make a purchasing decision. So right now, if you let's say that you're you run an ad campaign and you're like, man, it's taking me like three or four calls to close somebody. It's because this is the this is the magic of this. If it's taking you, you know, two or three calls, then that tells you that prospects need two or three hours of information in order to make a buying decision. And so, if you're efficient with it, those three-hour calls can probably be covered if you are specific in what the FAQs are and all the concerns and probably cover it in maybe 45 90 minutes if you're just very diligent about noting what the questions are. And I'll give you another pro tip on this, which is you want the FAQ to be in their language. So if someone says, "I'm really busy right now." You want to have a way to handle, "I'm really busy right now." Now, they might also say, "I've got a lot going on." Now, to you might you might be like, "Uh, cuz a salesman might think immediately, oh, well, that's just a timing objection." And the answer is yes, you're right. But the thing is is that someone might have six different ways of saying a timing objection. And you want to have an FAQ that covers each of those five or six ways because if you said that to a salesman and they said, "I'm really busy right now." And then you responded with uh how you would overcome someone saying, "I've got a lot of, you know, plate spinning," you would actually have a slightly different overcome for that or objection handler. And so we need to basically say it in their language and then say the overcome that's appropriate to each of those things. So yes, that means you're going to have have to have an answer for their questions. But this should hopefully demystify all of the black voodoo magic around what is in one of these videos. You're just answering their questions. That's it. Now, I always get this question. Should I put my price in the VSL or should I not put my price in the VSSL? The answer is it depends. All right. Now, the reason I say this is there are some businesses where um basically I tend to put price in in my stuff and that's because I have more demand than I can handle and I want to add friction to my process so that I can maximally utilize um you know the the the sales team, right? Not waste their time. If I had an an underutilized sales team, then I'd be probably more willing to not have the the money qualification there. I will say this though, the longer I've been doing business, the more I just end up putting all the information up front and everyone's always afraid of, you know, what if I what if I tell them, you know, the the price? It's like they're going to find out eventually, right? So, I tend to try and cover as many things before the sales call as humanly possible. Okay, so now you've got an ad. They clicked. They got the free thing. Now they've got the the video sales letter, which by the way, pro tip, you can actually put the the lead magnet inside of the VSSL if you want to. Uh so you be like, by the way, that thing about the girl thing, I'll tell you that in a second. Then you get to the first third of your VSSL. Then you can slice in the lead magnet and say, "Hey, by the way, this is that tip." And guess what? I have 28 other tips that you can follow, which I'll show you in this video. And then you go through it, right? Um so you can do either of those formats. Both of them work. But now we have to convert these people. All right? So, I'm going to put something here and then something here. Sorry that my little money that is a phone for everyone born before, you know, 2000 or after 2000. Okay, so what is B? I've talked about this before, so I'm not going to hit on this a lot, but you want to make sure they have budget, authority, need timing. Do they got the money to spend? They have the ability to make the decision. Do they need this thing? And is right now the time they want to buy? if we can answer those four things and you do that in the application or if you have a scheduler right where they're booking a call you make sure that those are the questions that are being asked there and you only and here's the tough part you actually only take calls with people who say they have the money to spend they have the authority to make the decision they have the need and they're willing to move forward now how much easier do of a call do you think it is when someone's gotten value from you they then fully understand the questions that someone might ask um around making purchasing decision from you they say they have the money the time they need the authority to do it now you're talking to them. How likely is it you think you're going to close them? Way higher than if you didn't have all that stuff, right? So, the reason that this process right here is the most efficient way of of converting traffic is that it's kind of like a microwave, right? You take someone from a cold prospect to a hot prospect. It's like you can, you know, you can slow cook it, you can simmer it, you can kind of bake it over time. I was
like, or you can just nuke that thing. And so this is basically like nuking a prospect. How do we how do we just bomb
them with all the because think about
like this. If someone's like, I followed
you for a year, right? If someone
followed short form for a year and let's
say they consumed five pieces a week, which would
be a crazy amount. It's 250 shorts.
Well, the average shorts, let's just be
generous here and say it's 30 seconds,
which it isn't. All right. So that would
mean that they've consumed 120 minutes,
about 2 hours. Okay. So, we can have
them consume 120 minutes over a year and
then buy. They've gotten that much
information in order to make a sale or
we can just have them consume all two
hours up front. And so, think about this
like I think a lot about about um sales
processes as a plane taking off. This is
my like this is my Alex's very simple
visual. All right. So, we've got our
plane, right? Here's our plane. Let's
put little wheels on our plane. I don't
know. Just go with it. All right. Here's
my plane. And we got to put a little the
little backwing thing. Oof, this is
tough. Okay, there's my there's my
terrible plane. All right, the thing is
is could this plane take off on this
runway? No, the plane's too big. So, I
have to increase the size of my runway
to give this plane enough lift to take
off. The size of this runway is the
amount of information that you need to
tell the prospect. And so, if we know
that someone needs two hours to make a
purchasing decision, then what do you
think we've done? They consume a little
bit here. They're going to consume, you
know, maybe 30 to 45 minutes here,
right? And then on the call, what do you
think we're going to get here? Another
hour. And so when we add all this
together, they've gotten about two hours
of information from us, but we did it in
the span of a couple days rather than
over a year, right? And this is why this
is kind of like the the ramrod, the the
fastest way of monetizing uh within a
business. Now, what happens to all the
leads that go through this process and
don't necessarily want to purchase
immediately? The logical people, the
people that actually make sense and
they're not crazy. Okay, so what do we
do with all these people? Well, we want
to put them somewhere that we give them
long-term nurture where we just say,
"Oh, you are just the type of person who
needs more information to make a
decision." No worries. Then I'm just
going to give you more information and
I'm going to do that provide more value
over a longer period of time. And so
that's where things like having a school
group where you just dump all the extra
leads into. And you keep making content
there and you answer their questions
there until eventually they're like,
"Hey, I do actually want to take some
action on this." And then boom, you send
them, you run them through the process,
you microwave them again, you reheat
them, right? And then boom, you make the
sale, right? That's the idea. So, this
long-term nurture, once people go
through that, they're still going to
come right back through the front door
again, and then get reheated. These are
the four steps. You make your ads, you
have a banger lead magnet, you have a
VSSL, and then you qualify the person
before the sale. And pro tip, you know,
you know, 4.5 is that for everybody who
doesn't buy, you have to put them in
some sort of either email sequence or
group or both where you continue to
provide value. you continue to basically
answer all these little FAQs that
they've had because maybe they've got
other ones or maybe they just need to
see more approve. Some people just need
more information to make the decision.
That's all it comes down to. And when
you do that and you provide as much
information as possible, you convert a
way higher percentage of the audience.
So, let me give you the the massive pro
tip, the thing that took me way too long
to understand. What do you think a brand
is? We're giving someone tons of
information over a long period of time
about who who we are, what we're about,
our way of doing things. And so the
reason that brands grow significantly
bigger than the people who just do this,
like if you just do this, you're going
to be able to make some money, but you
will quickly cap. You will be able to
make money, but you will cap. To build
the brand, we have to have this thing be
enormous. And then this thing ends up
being our eyeballs at the front of this
so that we have this enormous audience
of people that have gotten value from us
day in and day out for an extended
period of time. That is then what over
time if you it's like I think about it
like this. It's like you've got this
this this pyramid of people who are
interested in your stuff, right? And
this is as they you know get more
information, right? They move up the
pyramid. And so all we're going to do is
we're going to have these people are the
ones who give us money. And all these
people aren't going to do anything.
They're just going to get they're just
going to be like, man, this guy's great or this gal is great, right? So if we want to grow this this this little this little slice here, what do we do? Grow the bottom. You grow the base. And this fundamentally is what growing a brand is about. You're growing the base so that the top of the pyramid is way bigger than over here where you have to try and take someone up the elevator using the four-step process that I just walked through. So, that is my blueprint for unlocking your business's maximum monetization potential."
